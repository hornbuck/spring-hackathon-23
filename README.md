# The Game of Music

Welcome! In this game you will select 1 of 4 sprites:
beavy, who is our own OSU mascot, a turtle, a university of oregon duck, or a dangerous looking mountain lion!
After selection, players will be asked to follow the prompts by the AI interface so they race to climb the flag.
Keep an eye out on the terrain so players can navigate as quick as possible to the top using their keyboard's arrow keys.
Please enjoy our music selection during the race and remember to have fun!
Winners will be announced at the end of the race.

# Super Beaver Bros: An AI Adventure

## Description

Super Beaver Bros: An AI Adventure is a 2D platformer game, developed in Python using Pygame, designed for a hackathon with the theme of leveraging AI.

As part of this theme, we have incorporated two main AI components into our game:

1. A background generator powered by Dalle 2.
2. AI-generated text for our Non-Player Characters (NPCs), which provides a unique gameplay feel and can generate some laughs as the NPCs are snarky!

In Super Beaver Bros, you control the school's mascot, , and your main goal is to get from point A to point B. This journey is not a walk in the park, you will have to navigate through a series of challenging obstacles and meet several characters along the way. Notably, you will encounter the mascot from our rival school, the University of Oregon Duck (ew!) and our turtle friend who marks the end of your journey.

Once you've reached the Turtle, you've won! But don't worry, the fun doesn't have to stop there. You have the option to go through the course again, with new interactions and different backgrounds thanks to the AI-powered elements of the game!

## How to Play

1. Download, clone, or fork the repository to your local machine. You can do this by clicking on the green `Code` button on the main page of the repository and selecting your preferred method.
2. Before running the game, make sure you have installed the necessary libraries. This game requires `pygame` for the game mechanics and `openai` for the AI components. You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install pygame openai
```
3. Navigate to the directory where you stored the game files. Run beaver.py to start playing. You can do this from the command line:
```
python beavUp.py
```
Enjoy "Super Beaver Bros: An AI Adventure"! Navigate your beaver through the obstacles, engage with snarky NPCs, and make your way to victory!
